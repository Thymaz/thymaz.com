Behind  **Maazel**  lies  a  Paris-based  **genre-bending/multi-instrumentalist producer**  that  started  the  project  in  2015, mainly  focusing  on  making  **emotional  electronic  music**. His  experience  in  guitar  enabled  him  to  break  the  boundaries  of  genres  and  allowed  him  to  develop  his  **unique**  and  **recognizable  style**.


Weaving  in  and  out  of  **future  bass**  and  **chill  music**, he  started  releasing  his  first  originals  and  remixes  on  Soundcloud  and  caught  the  attention  of  the  american  producer  **graves**. The  two  ended  up  collaborating  on  a  track, ‘**Lost  Boys’**, that  generated  **more  than  4  million  plays**  and  became  an  **anthem**  of  the  genre. Things  snowballed  quickly  with  huge  names (such  as  **Diplo**, **Marshmello**  and  **Party  Favor**) playing  the  track  in  the  **biggest  festivals  in  the  world.** 


His  countless  remixes  of  instant  classics (**San  Holo**, **DROELOE**, **Skrillex**, **Vindata**, **CharliXCX**, ...) got  picked  up  by  renowned  curator  channels (**Trap  Nation**, **Trap  City**, **Too  Future**, ...) that  helped  draw  even  more  attention  to  his  work. He  then  focused  on  making  original  tracks (‘Higher’, ‘Fire’ and ‘Red  Moon’) that  best  represented  his  love  for  **electric  guitar**  and  **emotional**  electronic  music, helping  him  become  a  very  promising  newcomer  of  the  genre.


He  has  also  played  in  **direct  support**  of  industry’s  heavyweights  such  as  **Illenium**, **Dillon  Francis**, **What  So  Not**  and  **Grandtheft**  for  their  shows  in  some  of  the  most  renowned  clubs  in  the  french  capital.'
