Behind **Maazel** lies a Paris-based **genre-bending/multi-instrumentalist producer** that started the project in 2015, mainly focusing on making **emotional electronic music**. His experience in guitar enabled him to break the boundaries of genres and allowed him to develop his **unique** and **recognizable style**.

Weaving in and out of **future bass** and **chill music**, he started releasing his first originals and remixes on Soundcloud and caught the attention of big names. It ended up in collaborations such as **‘Lost Boys’** that generated more than **4 million plays** and became an **anthem** of the genre. Things snowballed quickly with huge names (such as **Diplo**, **Marshmello** and **Party Favor**) playing the track in the **biggest festivals in the world**.

His countless remixes of instant classics (**San Holo**, **DROELOE**, **Skrillex**, **Vindata**, **CharliXCX**, ...) got picked up by renowned curator channels (**Trap Nation**, **Trap City**, **Too Future**, ...) that helped draw even more attention to his work. He then focused on making original tracks (**[In My Head](https://fanlink.to/maazel-in-my-head)**, **[Higher](https://fanlink.to/maazel-higher)**, **[Fire](https://fanlink.to/maazel-fire)** and **[Red Moon](https://fanlink.to/maazel-red-moon)**) that best represented his love for **electric guitar** and electronic music, helping him become a very promising newcomer of the genre.

During the **summer of 2019**, he released his collaboration with **Gill Chang** on **MrSuicideSheep**’s new imprint **“found/red”** as well as a new team effort on **Kayzo’s label** : **Welcome records**, both tracks peaking at **hundreds of thousands plays** only a month after their release. In **september of 2020**, he made a notable debut on **Monstercat** with **‘Right Now’** (featuring **glasscat**) which is the first single off of **his upcoming EP**.

He has also played in **direct support** of industry’s heavyweights such as **Illenium**, **Dillon Francis**, **What So Not** and **Grandtheft** for their shows in some of **the most renowned clubs** in the french capital.
